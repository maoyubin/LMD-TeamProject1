#LMD Team Project 1

##Team: Fierce-Killer-Whale
###Lena Faure and Ruben Ruiz

Lena Faure and Ruben Ruiz join forces to create Team Fierce-Killer-Whale. Team project 1 is to build out Books.Modern Developer UI based on a mockup provided by the Modern Developer team.


##Workflow and workload

###Project 1
We've decided to use github and QA.modern developer to communicate for this first project. The workload is split in the folowing way: 

Ruben: create layout of page (structure, header, nav, footer)

Lena: create the "book" section

Since the layout comes first, Ruben creates the Github project and Lena will collaborate on.


###Project 2
Lena will create the repo and Ruben will pull request with his work.

Lena: Evens

Ruben: Odds

We then link to that repo from our coursework repo, in the README.md for the chapter.
